# 🌐 GCP Data Pipeline Project – Employee Data Analysis

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end **data pipeline** built using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services. We created a mock employee dataset and processed it through a modern data pipeline using:

- **Cloud Data Fusion** for data ingestion and transformation  
- **BigQuery** for data storage and analysis  
- **Cloud Composer (Airflow)** to orchestrate the pipeline using DAGs  
- **Looker Studio** to design business-focused KPI dashboards  

This project showcases how to turn raw data into meaningful insights using scalable cloud tools.

**Flow Description**:
- Data is extracted using a Python script (scheduled with **Cloud Composer** / **Airflow**)
- Data is saved to **Cloud Storage**
- **Cloud Data Fusion** picks up the data, performs transformations, and loads it into **BigQuery**
- **Looker Studio** visualizes the processed data with business KPIs
